## JS Facial Recognition In-Browser

### Libraries Used:  
[face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/blob/master/README.md)  

This app needs to be run either on a local or live server to run.  
I attached a screenshot below to demo it instead of serving it live  

### Goals  
- Learn about existing facial recognition libraries written in javascript and leverage them to demo real-time facial recognition functionality  
- Learn additional javascript elements that I use less often (video manipulation, canvas, etc)  

### Functionality (more features exist that weren't used)  
- identifies and draws a box around face in real-time using the webcam  
- displays and updates its prediction for facial expression
- displays its confidence level for each prediction
